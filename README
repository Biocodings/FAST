FAST --- Fast Analysis of Sequences Toolbox
Version 1.0

The Fast Analysis of Sequences Toolbox (FAST) is a set of approximately 15
executable tools designed to interoperate at the UNIX command-line for rapid
and reproducible prototyping of precise and powerful bioinformatic sequence
workflows.  Modeled after the UNIX command-line text utilities (such as
grep, cut, and sort), FAST tools such as fasgrep, fascut and fassort
exchange data through UNIX pipes (|) in standard bioinformatic formats (such
as Fasta) and operate on a per-sequence rather than per-line basis. FAST
tools expose the power of Bioperl in an easy-to-learn command-line paradigm,
without any programming otherwise required.
