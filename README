FAST --- Fast Analysis of Sequences Toolbox
Version 1.0

The Fast Analysis of Sequences Toolbox (FAST) is a set of UNIX tools
(for example fasgrep, fascut, fashead and fastr) for sequence
bioinformatics modeled after the UNIX textutils (such as grep, cut,
head, tr, etc). FAST workflows are designed for "inline" (serial)
processing of flatfile biological sequence record databases
per-sequence, rather than per-line, through UNIX pipelines. The
default data exchange format is multifasta (specifically, a
restriction of BioPerl FastA format). FAST is designed for
learnability, interoperability, interface consistency, rapid
prototyping, fine-tuned control, and reproducibility. FAST tools
expose the power of Perl and BioPerl to users in an easy-to-learn
command-line paradigm.

UTILITIES

FAST 1.0 contains the following utilities. Each has its own man
page. FAST utilities may be classifed as for annotation, selection,
transformation, and analysis.

annotation
----------
faslen     -- annotate sequence lengths
fascodon   -- tally/annotate codon usage
fascomp    -- tally/annotate monomer frequencies
fasxl      -- translate gapped and ungapped sequences and alignments
fasrc      -- reverse complement nucleotide sequences and alignments

selection
---------
fasgrep    -- select sequence records by perl regular expressions
fasfilter  -- select sequence records by numerical values
fastax     -- select sequence records by NCBI taxonomy IDs or names
fascut     -- select/reorder sequence record data by position
fasuniq    -- remove duplicate sequence records from sorted data
fashead    -- select leading sequence records
fastail    -- select trailing sequence records
alncut     -- select sites based on variation and gap-content
gbfcut     -- select sequences by regex match on features in a GenBank file
gbfalncut  -- select sites by regex match on features in a GenBank file

transformation
--------------
fasconvert -- convert sequences to or from from fasta format
fassort    -- sort sequence records
fastaxsort -- sort sequence records by NCBI taxonomy IDs or names
faspaste   -- concatenate sequence records
fastr      -- transform sequence records by character, degap
fassub     -- transform sequence records by regex-based substitutions

analysis
--------
faswc      -- tally sequences and characters
alnpi      -- calculate molecular population genetic statistics 


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	(sudo) make install

DOCUMENTATION

Installation generates a man page for each utility. From the installation
directory, additional resources are in ./doc, particularly the FAST_Cookbook
