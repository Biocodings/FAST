Revision history for FAST

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

1.00    First post to CPAN
1.01    Disabled much testing for the unfortunate reason of portability issues with Test::Script::Run
1.02    Removed some libraries that were causing permission problems: one involving Nexml from BioPerl 
        and the other Pod::Usage -- Pod::Usage listed as a dep for download from CPAN now
1.03    Added use v5.10.1 in lib/FAST.pm and Makefile.pm because of "use parent" in FAST::Bio::SeqIO
