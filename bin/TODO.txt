I/O -- FIX TO CURRENT INTERFACE


CODING
fasfilter -- generalize for numerical filtering by description
fascomp -- put fasposcomp functionality in fascomp. 
alnpi, fascodon -- enable output in description for use with fasfilter
fasuniq -- fix to work on sorted data (currently works on sequence information; needs to work on id and desc.)
fasxl -- verify gapped translation functionality
