abstract = {We describe a versatile and extensible integrated bioinformatics toolkit for the analysis of biological sequences over the Internet. The web portal offers convenient interactive access to a growing pool of chainable bioinformatics software tools and databases that are centrally installed and maintained by the RZG. Currently, supported tasks comprise sequence similarity searches in public or user-supplied databases, computation and validation of multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analysis and protein-structure prediction. Individual tools can be seamlessly chained into pipelines allowing the user to conveniently process complex workflows without the necessity to take care of any format conversions or tedious parsing of intermediate results. The toolkit is part of the Max-Planck Integrated Gene Analysis System (MIGenAS) of the Max Planck Society available at www.migenas.org (click 'Start Toolkit').},

@article{Smith1994,
abstract = {An X-Windows-based graphic user interface is presented which allows the seamless integration of numerous existing biomolecular programs into a single analysis environment. This environment is based on a core multiple sequence editor that is linked to external programs by a user-expandable menu system and is supported on Sun and DEC workstations. There is no limitation to the number of external functions that can be linked to the interface. The length and number of sequences that can be handled are limited only by the size of virtual memory present on the workstation. The sequence data itself is used as the reference point from which analysis is done, and scalable graphic views are supported. It is suggested that future software development utilizing this expandable, user-defined menu system and the I/O linkage of external programs will allow biologists to easily integrate expertise from disparate fields into a single environment.},

@article{White2014,
abstract = {Species delimitation (grouping individuals into distinct taxonomic groups) is an essential part of evolutionary, conservation, and molecular ecology. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcodes, short fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, are being used in environmental bioassessments to assign specimens to putative species, but no method for delimiting DNA barcodes into species-level entities is universally accepted. We investigated the effect of delimitation methods on outcomes of bioassessments based on DNA barcodes. We used 2 tree-construction methods (neighbor joining [NJ], maximum likelihood [ML]) and 4 classes of species-delimitation criteria (distance-based, bootstrap support, reciprocal monophyly, and coalescentbased) with a DNA barcode data set consisting of 3 genera and 2202 COI sequences. We compared species delimitations for Baetis (Ephemeroptera:Baetidae), Eukiefferiella (Diptera:Chironomidae), and Simulium (Diptera: Simuliidae) from different streams. We assessed congruence among trees and compared species abundances and estimated species richness among methods. NJ followed by use of a standard barcoding distance cutoff (2\%) yielded the greatest number of putative species. All other delimitation methods yielded similar, but lower, richness. Differences in species delimitations produced by various methods might have been caused by confounding factors, such as possible parthenogenesis in Baetis and rare haplotypes in abundant species of Baetis and Simulium. Eukiefferiella presented the fewest discrepancies among delimitations. Each method can be regarded as producing a separate line of evidence contributing to the delimitation of separately evolving lineages. The increased resolution offered by DNA barcoding can yield important insights into the natural history of organisms, but the power of these observations is limited without the use of multigene and multilocus data sets.},

@article{Benson2009,
abstract = {GenBank is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 300,000 organisms named at the genus level or lower, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank(R) staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleotide Sequence Database in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI Homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.},

@article{Stajich2002,
abstract = {The Bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of Perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.},
